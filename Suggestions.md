## 1. Could the code be made more efficient??

### a. Efficient way of computing BMU or winning neuron

```bash
distances = np.linalg.norm(self.weights - vector, axis=2)
np.unravel_index(np.argmin(distances), (self.width, self.height))
```

### b. Vectorizing the nested Loops

The nested loops for updating weights can be replaced with vectorized operations using NumPy, which significantly enhances performance

```bash
x, y = np.indices((self.width, self.height))
distance_grid = (x - bmu[0])**2 + (y - bmu[1])**2
theta = np.exp(-distance_grid / (2 * sigma_decay ** 2))[:, :, np.newaxis]
self.weights += alpha_decay * theta * (vector - self.weights)
```



## 2. Is the code best structured for later use by other developers and in anticipation of productionisation?

###  a. Object Oriented Code Writing

Encapsulate the SOM logic within a class to enhance reusability and maintainability:

```bash 

class SelfOrganizingMap:
    def __init__(self, width, height, input_dim, learning_rate=0.1, sigma=None):
        # Initialization code
        pass
        
    def train(self, data, num_iterations):
        # Training code
        pass
        
    def find_bmu(self, vector):
        # finding the winning neuron code
        pass
    
    
    def update_weights(self, vector, bmu, t, max_iter):
        # Weight update code
        pass

```

### b. Modularization of the code 
The current Script lacks modularity and scalability.

* __data_loader.py__: Handles data loading and preprocessing.

* __som.py__: Contains the Self-Organizing Map class and training methods.

* __visualization.py__: Handles all plotting and image saving functionalities.

* __main.py__: Serves as the entry point for training and evaluation.​



### c. Adopting Standard Project Structure

Follow the common practices for MLOps

```bash
project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/                  # Raw input data
│   └── processed/            # Preprocessed data
├── models/                   # Saved model weights
├── notebooks/                # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── data_loader.py        # Data loading and preprocessing
│   ├── som.py                # SOM class and training methods
│   ├── visualization.py      # Visualization utilities
│   └── main.py               # Entry point for training and evaluation
├── tests/                    # Unit and integration tests
├── requirements.txt          # Project dependencies
├── Dockerfile                # Docker configuration
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## 3. How would you approach productionising this application?

### a. Implementing MLOps practices
Adopt MLops to streamline deployment and monitoring ML Models

* __CI/CD pipelines__: Building pipelines for testing and automatic deployment using tools likes GitHub Actions
* __Model Versioning__: Use MLflow or DVC to track both data versions and ML models.
* __Monitoring__: Implement monitoring for model performance using Grafana 

### b. Containerization
Package the application using Docker to ensure consistency across environments:

```bash 
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "src/main.py"]

```

### c. Deploy Using Cloud Services
Leverage cloud platforms for scalability and reliability:​

* __AWS__: Use Amazon SageMaker for training and deploying models.
* __GCP__: Utilize Vertex AI for end-to-end ML workflows.
* __Azure__: Employ Azure Machine Learning for model management and deployment.


## 4. Anything else you think is relevant

### a. Implementing comprehensive testing to ensure reliability:​

* __Unit Tests__: Test individual functions and methods.

* __Integration Tests__: Test the interaction between different modules.

### b. Logging and Monitoring
Incorporating logging to facilitate debugging and monitoring:​

```bash 
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info("Training started")
```

Using monitoring tools to track application performance and detect anomalies.​

### c. Documentation

Maintaining thorough documentation to help future development and onboarding:​

* __Code Comments__: Have clear explainations of complex logic within the code.

* __README__: Providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage examples.

* __API Documentation__: Using tools like SwaggerUI
